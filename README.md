# Powercalc
Tools and documentation for power analysis, sample size requirements, minimum detectable effects (MDE) calculation, as well as relevant literature.

The most useful resources here that I would recommend for getting started are the "Power analysis training for LAC RADS.pptx" presentation in the root folder and the generic power calculation spreadsheet in the tools folder ("Generic Cluster Design Power Calc.xlsx")
